Well, I finally got round to creating this website. It's my 5th year as a UX designer and I haven't got a decent portfolio. I just never found a tool that I felt comfortable using to create one. As an ex java developer, I also worked out that I didn't hate coding, I used hated backend dev. So, here's my attempt to learn some HTML, CSS and Javascript and create a kick-ass Portfolio as we go along. 

I've learnt a delightful thing today - I can incorporate Jerkyll (http://jerkyllrb.com) so can use Markdown to author my posts. That's much easier than I thought creating a blog might be.

Here's what my current portfolio looks like: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PXrh6hX5beEu9kVZdvG5lwpn_lp1vBN_vVgp3mi4Kpw/edit#slide=id.g3cc8c31ed0_1_35. You can follow me on my journey to create a decent one that shows you how passionate I am about great UX.
