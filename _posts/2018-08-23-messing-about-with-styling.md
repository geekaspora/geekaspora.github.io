So, I made the first step but how do I move things along? I haven't done any branding work yet so I don't know what colours I want to use for this site yet. I do know that I'll nee to change the fonts (maybe), create some accessible styling and perhaps change the background from white. So today i decided to test a few things. 

## What am I aiming for?
There are three things I'd like to accomplish today. 
1. Change the background of this blog post to millenial pink
2. Create a "link" style for links
3. Display a link within a blog post such as the one to my old portfolio. 

## What did I do?
*Changing the background:* I modified the main.css file. I updated the background colour of the body to the basic "pink" which, to my delight, is millenial pink. 

*Creating the link style:* I changed the colour of the links from the #999 that was included in my initial code to the hex value #3278B8 which is a blue that I was using for a client's website. 

*Creating links within my posts:* I googled how to do this and I'm going to try it here. [Chimmy's shitty portfolio](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PXrh6hX5beEu9kVZdvG5lwpn_lp1vBN_vVgp3mi4Kpw/edit#slide=id.gc6f80d1ff_0_0)

Woo! it works. 

I started off with unformatted text and so I googled some more to work out how to add italics, create paragraphs, modify the default style for the lists so that I didn't get weirdly small list text, and also how to create headings. This means that there's a pretty beautiful blog post up and I'll be able to write about the before and after of these when I set up all of these locally and can upload the screenshots that I'm taking.
