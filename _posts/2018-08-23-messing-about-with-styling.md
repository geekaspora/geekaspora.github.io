So, I made the first step but how do I move things along? I haven't done any branding work yet so I don't know what colours I want to use for this site yet. I do know that I'll nee to change the fonts (maybe), create some accessible styling and perhaps change the background from white. So today i decided to test a few things. 

There are three things I'd like to accomplish today. 
1. Change the background of this blog post to millenial pink
2. Create a "link" style for links
3. Display a link within a blog post such as the one to my old portfolio. 

##What did I do?

*Changing the background:* I modified the main.css file. I updated the background colour of the body to the basic "pink" which, to my delight, is millenial pink. 

*Creating the link style:* I changed the colour of the links from the #999 that was included in my initial code to the hex value #3278B8 which is a blue that I was using for a client's website. 

*Creating links within my posts:* I googled how to do this and I'm going to try it here. [Chimmy's shitty portfolio](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PXrh6hX5beEu9kVZdvG5lwpn_lp1vBN_vVgp3mi4Kpw/edit#slide=id.gc6f80d1ff_0_0)
Woo! it works. 

I think that's all for now
